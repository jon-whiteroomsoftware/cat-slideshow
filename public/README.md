# Cat Slideshow

[Try the app here](https://jon-whiteroomsoftware.github.io/cat-slideshow/)

I'm late to the React Hooks party. Up to this point I've barely written any Hooks code. I wanted to implement a somewhat useful app that let me explore the basic hooks and write some useful custom hooks.

### Functionality/Features

- Select which breeds you want to see photos of
- Use next and previous arrows to scroll through photos
- Prefetch photo data and images in the background
- Show a loading spinner when the API or image loading backs up

### Navigating the code

### Code review - what I'm looking for

- Any and all feedback from major abstraction issues down to the nittiest of nits
- Advice on missing features
